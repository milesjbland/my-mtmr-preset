## Setup

After installing MTMR, open the preferences and replace the contents with the `items.json` from this repo.

### Weather

In order to use the weather plugin, you will need to sign up to [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/) to get an API key. See [https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR#weather](https://github.com/Toxblh/MTMR#weather)
